PROJECT (Tata 1mg) This blog is a short explanatory blog of our experience on making our own website clone . I would love to share my experience of working on a project assigned to me by Masai School. The goal was to clone the website - “Tata 1mg” and successfully apply our skills that we learned so far. I have to say it was far more difficult than I thought it would be. I learned what cannot be taught , but it must be experienced.

Tata 1mg, previously 1mg, is a healthcare platform based in Gurgaon, India. It provides services, including e-pharmacy, diagnostics, e-consultation and health content. It was founded in April 2015 by Prashant Tandon, Gaurav Agarwal and Vikas Chauhan.
